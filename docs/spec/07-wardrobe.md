# Wardrobe

The domain of the app: garments with a colour of the palette of *A Dictionary of Color
Combinations* (Sanzo Wada, 1933), the combinations of the book, and the outfits that a wardrobe
gives for them. Its files are `src/wada.js`, `src/palette.js`, `tests/palette.test.js`.

## Palette

- **PAL-1** The palette is `COLORS` of `src/wada.js`: 159 colours `{ id, name, hex, combinations }`,
  from `colors.json` of `mattdesl/dictionary-of-colour-combinations` (MIT). `id` is the index of
  the colour in that file. The combinations are numbered 1 to 348, each of 2, 3 or 4 colours, in
  the order of the file.
- **PAL-2** The colour names are proper names of the book. They stay in English in `src/wada.js`
  as data, not as text of the catalogs; this is the one exception to the rule that every text for
  the user is in `src/locales/`.
- **PAL-3** The distance of two colours is CIE76 ΔE over CIELAB with a D65 white, computed from
  the `hex` of each colour. `nearestColor` takes a `#rrggbb` value in any case and gives the id of
  the palette colour with the smallest distance; any other value gives null.
