# Specification

This is the specification of Attire as it is on `main`. It states what the app does, not
how the work was planned. The code and its tests are the authority: when a rule here and the code
differ, one of the two has a defect.

The names of the screen are the English ones; `src/locales/es.js` is the source wording.

## Rule identifiers

Each rule has an identifier, a prefix and a number, such as `GAR-3`. An identifier is stable: a
rule that goes away keeps its number, marked as removed, and a new rule gets the next number. Use
the identifier in a commit body or in a test name to point at a rule.

The rules DS-1 to DS-8 and LAY-1 to LAY-4 belong to the design system, `pwa-design-system`.
[04-design-system.md](04-design-system.md) says where they are.

| Section | One of the screens of the navigation: Wardrobe, Combinations and Settings |
| Module | A part of the app that Settings turns off, with its sections |
| Pane | The list and the detail of one entry, side by side in the expanded class |

## Upkeep

A change of behaviour changes the rule here in the same commit as the code. A new feature adds its
rules to the document of its area, or adds a document and a row in the tables above.

`tests/spec.test.js` and `.githooks/pre-commit` enforce this; see the rules ENG-12 to ENG-15 in
[01-engineering.md](01-engineering.md).
